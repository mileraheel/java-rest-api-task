# eGym Recruiting Coding Task

**Do not share this project or its solution with people outside of eGym GmbH!**

## Technologies used in the project

* Oracle/Open JDK 1.7 or 1.8 (must be pre-installed).
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) for build automation.
* [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) for dependency injection.
* [JPA/Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/) for persistence.
* [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net/) for REST endpoints.
* [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) for manual API testing and API documentation.
* [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) for unit testing.
* [Mockito](http://mockito.org/) for mocked testing.
* [Rest Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) for integration testing.

## How to Build and Run the Project

This project uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system, you can build the project locally just by typing the
following in the console:

```
./gradlew build
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

The output of the Gradle build is located in the  `build/` directory.

To run the project deploy the war-File in the `build/libs` directory to the application server of your choice.
Alternatively, you can use the Gradle Jetty plugin:

```
./gradlew jettyRun
```

### Swagger

Browse to the application root for API documentation:

[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080)

All REST endpoints can be tested locally with the Swagger UI frontend.

## How to Extend the Project

If you want to import the project in an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA then Gradle provides a way to generate all
the necessary project files.

Generate Eclipse project:
```
./gradlew cleanEclipse eclipse
```

Generate IntelliJ IDEA project:
```
./gradlew cleanIdea idea
```

Alternatively, with IntelliJ IDEA you can also import the project from the Gradle model,
just follow [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/importing-project-from-gradle-model.html).

## Tasks

You have to write a full working backend for managing exercises.
You will be provided with a working code skeleton and you will need to implement following functionalities:

1. Task:
    - Persist new exercises:
        - Insert new exercises.
        - Update exercise.
        - All exercise fields should be mandatory for inserting (except the id) and updating.
        - Use an appropriate HTTP status code if the input is invalid.
        - Check if the provided description has a valid syntax (only alphnum + spaces)
          by using a simple regular expression.
        - During exercise persisting it should be checked that there
          is no other exercise already present for the user id, in the
          period (start + duration) where the new exercise will take place.
          If this is the case return an HTTP status code `Conflict` with appropriate
          error message.
        - While updating an exercise, the user id and type shouldn't change.
    - Delete an existing exercise by a given exercise id.
    - List all existing exercises for a given user id.
        - Add the ability to filter them by type and/or by date.
    - Adapt the methods of TestClientService in the test environment to run all tests of the ExerciseBasicTest class.
        - Remove the @Ignore annotations.
2. Task
    - Create a REST end point in the ExerciseService with the following logic:
        - Define a way to rank a list of user ids by the users' points:
        - the points are calculated as follows:
            - A user gets points for each exercise he has completed in the past 4 weeks.
            - A user gets one point per minute of the duration of the exercise plus the burnt kilo calories.
            - Each time a user performs the same type of exercise again it is worth 10% less (Make sure to look at the newest exercises first).
                Example: A user ran 4 times in the past 4 weeks (let's say once per week).
                This weeks run is worth 100%. The oldest run is worth only 70% of the calculated points for the exercise.
            - An exercise can't count for less than 0 points.
        - Each exercise type has a multiplication factor for the point calculation:
            - RUNNING - 2
            - CYCLING - 2
            - SWIMMING - 3
            - ROWING - 2
            - WALKING - 1
            - CIRCUIT_TRAINING - 4
            - STRENGTH_TRAINING - 3
            - FITNESS_COURSE - 2
            - SPORTS - 3
            - OTHER - 1
        - return a list of user ids. Order them according to the users' points in descending order.
    - Adapt the method of TestClientService in the test environment to run all tests of the RankingBasicTest class.
        - Remove the @Ignore annotations.
3. Task (Optional)
	The third task is the Summary by Exercise Type in the Exercise Service.
	It takes Type as a parameter and looks for last 4 weeks exercise data and then sums up all the information user-wise.
	It will show records user wise by Type, for example RUNNING, so All the Runnings done by different users will be summed and shown sorted by the duration of RUNNING that the have done.
	A user may have his favourite exercise and he only does SWIMMING not any other, so he may want to see how many swimmers are around and how are others performing and where does he amoung all the other swimmers falls in the list.
    

## How to Submit Your Solution

Before submitting make sure your project builds successfully by executing the following command:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

Then zip the project, but before that make sure to remove all binary/compiled data by doing a clean:
```
./gradlew clean
```

Send your solution as zip file using the [this online form](https://script.google.com/a/macros/egym.de/s/AKfycbwVMmgwNOQ_iq1Vk3z-FyJU_eQdx8QvzVUx9wbaFEXFNxi0uYnc/exec).
In order to avoid any misunderstandings, please fill out the same email and name you used in your application.

## Evaluation Criteria

- All tasks have to be finished.
- Your solution should be free of bugs.
- Each test has to run without failure.
  - The TestClientService class must be implemented for that.
    - Please don't change the method definition of the TestClientService.
  - Your coding task will be tested by a large number of tests.
- You should implement proper error handling.
- Write properly styled code.
- Think of a good REST end point design. Make it smart and clear.
